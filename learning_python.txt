So far I heve learned about variables and strings.
I have also learned about for loop and while loops
I have learned about lists and dictionaries, as well
as how to work with user inputs
I am struggling to learn functions and classes,
but I believe that with persistence and more practice
that I will be able to get them down.
For the lesson I am learning about file and will later 
learn about exceptions and how to text my code.
My hope is that I can put together a good portfolio to 
show to recruiters to get my first role working with Python.
